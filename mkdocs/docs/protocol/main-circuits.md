# Main Circuits

This iden3 circuits are the heart of the protocol. The main ones are: 

- [`stateTransition.circom`](main-circuits.md#statetransition), checks the execution of the [identity state transition](../getting-started/state-transition/state-transition.md) by taking the old identity state and the new identity state as inputs.
- [`authV2.circom`](main-circuits.md#authv2), checks that the prover is owner of an identity.
- [`credentialAtomicQueryMTPV2.circom`](./main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerymtpv2), checks that a claim issued to the prover (and added to issuer's Claims Tree) satisfies a query set by the verifier.
- [`credentialAtomicQueryMTPV2OnChain.circom`](./main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerymtpv2onchain), checks that a claim issued to the prover (and added to issuer's Claims Tree) satisfies a query set by the verifier and the verifier is a smart contract.
- [`credentialAtomicQuerySigV2.circom`](./main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerysigv2) checks that a claim issued to the prover (and signed by the Issuer) satisfies a query set by the verifier.
- [`credentialAtomicQuerySigV2OnChain.circom`](./main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerymtpv2onchain) checks that a claim issued to the prover (and signed by the Issuer) satisfies a query set by the verifier and the verifier is a smart contract.

> You can find all the source code on [Github - Iden3 Circuits](https://github.com/iden3/circuits). All the proving and verification keys necessary to use the circuits were generated after a Trusted Setup Ceremony.

#### Scope

- If oldState is genesis, verifies that userID is derived from the oldUserState (= genesis state). Performed using [`cutId()`](https://github.com/iden3/circuits/blob/master/circuits/lib/utils/treeUtils.circom#L184), [`cutState()`](https://github.com/iden3/circuits/blob/master/circuits/lib/utils/treeUtils.circom#L198)and [`isEqual()`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/comparators.circom#L37) templates
- newUserState is different than zero using [`isZero()`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/comparators.circom#L24) comparator
- oldUserState and newUserState are different using `isEqual()`
- Verifies user's identity ownership using [`idOwnershipBySignature(IdOwnershipLevels)`](./main-circuits.md#idownershipbysignature) template. The challenge signed by the user is `H(oldstate, newstate)` where `H` is a Poseidon hash function executed inside the [`Poseidon(nInputs)`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/poseidon.circom#L198) template
- Verifies that the auth claim exists in the `newClaimsTreeRoot` using [`checkClaimExists(IdOwnershipLevels)` template](https://github.com/iden3/circuits/blob/master/circuits/lib/stateTransition.circom#L91)
- Verifies that the new state (`newUserState`) matches the hash of the new claims tree root (`newClaimsTreeRoot`), revocation tree root (`newRevTreeRoot`) and roots tree root (`newRootsTreeRoot`) using [`checkIdenStateMatchesRoots()`](https://github.com/iden3/circuits/blob/master/circuits/lib/stateTransition.circom#L96)

The circuit takes a query by a verifier and a claim owned by the prover and generate a proof that the claim satisfies the query. In particular, it checks that: 

1. Checks that the prover is owner of an identity by idOwnershipBySignature template
2. Verifies that the identity is the subject of the claim
3. Verifies that the claim is included in the issuer's claim tree
4. Verifies that the claim schema matches the one in the query
5. Verifies that the claim is not revoked by the issuer and is not expired
6. Verifies that the query posed by the verifier is satisfied by the claim

- [**Circuit Specific Files (From Trusted Setup)**](https://iden3-circuits-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/latest.zip)


This circuit should be used for smart contract verifiers. This circuits does all the checks that the the [credentialAtomicQueryMTPV2](https://github.com/iden3/docs/blob/master/mkdocs/docs/protocol/main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerymtpv2) circuit does, plus the following:

1. Checks that prover controls the identity the same way as the AuthV2 circuit checks it
2. Calculates hash of the query inputs, like claimSchema, slotIndex, operator, claimPathKey, claimPathNotExists and values as an output for all the query related inputs.
This reduces the number of public inputs and much cheaper for Smart Contracts to verify the proof.

- [**Circuit Specific Files (From Trusted Setup)**](https://iden3-circuits-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/latest.zip)


This circuit checks that an issuer has issued a claim for identity and validates ownership of that identity in the following manner:

1. Checks that the prover is owner of an identity by idOwnershipBySignature template
2. Verifies that the identity is the subject of the claim
3. Verifies that the claim was signed by the issuer
4. Verifies that the claim schema matches the one in the query
5. Verifies that the claim is not revoked by the issuer and is not expired
6. Verifies that the query posed by the verifier is satisfied by the claim
